Why not have an application which guests can install\\n(or run on their mobile browsers) which allowed them to look through an electronic menu and then create\\nan order for themselves.. As in the customer get's what they want fully organised from their device,\\nthen when the waiter comes around they just site their reference number and their order is added to the table under\\neither the whole tables bill or a partial bill of which is separate from the main (as in, person A has their bill\\nand so does person B).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I soon realized after this that this adds tons of other possibilities, so I started out on creating a MySQL\\nbased android application for restaurants.
