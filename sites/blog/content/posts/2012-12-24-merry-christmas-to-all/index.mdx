Merry Christmas to all.

Just thought I would make a quick update. I am probably going to abandon idea of making the RPG cross platform
to mobile devices... Instead I will work on more phone related apps for mobile devices..
I am also considering making the RPG engine sudo 3D (2.5D), doing so will make it look a lot less
old school and will open up creativity potential from people whom use it.

On Christmas eve I opened one present (as is tradition with my family) I got a network crimping kit :)
Just spent a little while going through and fixing all my broken RJ45 connectors :) Best present ever.

Hope everyone reading has a merry Christmas and a happy new year!!
