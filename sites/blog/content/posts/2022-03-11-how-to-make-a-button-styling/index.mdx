## Step 2: Button styling

Not too much to say about this part but here is the code:

<StepTwoDemo />
<br />

The look and feel of our buttons will typically come from a designer, but as you can see
here we are setting some of these values with css variables as such as "`--btn-background-color`" and "`--btn-background-color-hover`"
if you want to know more about this I go into depth <Link to="/blog/2022/03/how-to-make-a-button-normalisation/#root-and-global-css-variables">in an earlier post</Link>.

The thing to take away from here is "`:focus`" and "`:focus-visible`", I see too often people wiping away inbuilt focus indicators
with css as such as "`outline: none`" DO NOT DO THIS! Or if you are going to do this replace it with some other indicator of focus,
this is such a massive let down on the accessibility side and no matter how much your designer tells you that you don't need it
you 100% do. If you cannot tab through your website and use it reliably you are letting people down! In my case I simply create
a custom outline that looks nicer that the bog-standard outline.
