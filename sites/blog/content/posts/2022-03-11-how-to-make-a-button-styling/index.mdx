### Step 2: Button styling

Not too much to say about this part but here is the code:

<StepTwoDemo />
<br />

Typically, how the button looks and interacts with hover is more of a design decision per application, but as you can see
here we are setting some of these values with css variables as such as "`--btn-background-color`" and "`--btn-background-color-hover`"
once again this is being done for the later steps, customisation.

The thing to take away from here is "`:focus`" and "`:focus-visible`", I see too often people wiping away inbuilt focus indicators
with css as such as "`outline: none`" DO NOT DO THIS! Or if you are going to do this replace it with some other indicator of focus
this is such a massive let down on the accessibility side and no matter how much your designer tells you that you don't need it
you 100% do. If you cannot tab through your website and use it reliably you are letting people down! In my case I simply create
a custom outline that looks nicer that the bog standard outline.
