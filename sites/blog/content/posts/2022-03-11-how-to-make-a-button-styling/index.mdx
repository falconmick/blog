## Step 2: Button styling

Not too much to say about this part, but here is the code:

<StepTwoDemo />

The look and feel of our buttons will typically come from a designer, but as you can see here, we are setting some of
these values with css variables such as "`--btn-background-color`" and "`--btn-background-color-hover`"
if you want to know more about this I go into depth <Link to="/blog/2022/03/how-to-make-a-button-normalisation/#root-and-global-css-variables">in an earlier post</Link>.

The thing to take away from here is "`:focus`" and "`:focus-visible`". I see too often people wiping away inbuilt focus
indicators with css such as "outline: none" **do not do this**! Or if you are going to do this, replace it with some other
indicator of focus, this is such a massive letdown on the accessibility side, and no matter how much your designer tells
you that you don't need it, you 100% do. You let your user down if you cannot tab through your website and use it reliably!
In my case, I create a custom outline that looks nicer than the bog-standard outline.
