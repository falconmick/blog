## Final Step 3: Customisation

Throughout this blog post there have been multiple occurrences in which I have utilised css variables with some quick wins
but nothing too substantial coming from it. This is where it all comes together, this is where we really see the benefits of
css variables and how they play such a key role!

Instead of showing the final demo again I am simply going to highlight ways in which you can customise your buttons, if you
want the full code <Link to="/blog/2022/03/how-to-make-a-button/">click here to go to the first post</Link> First up is creating a new class to
create a new type of button:

<StepThreeDemo
  demoOne
  code={`
.btn.btn-green {
  --btn-color: #232323;
  --btn-background-color: #5cdb5c;
  --btn-background-color-hover: #7ce27c;
}
  `}
/>
<br />

This is what button perfection looks like in my eyes, you set up your styles in such a way that when you want to have a new
color theme you literally just tell the button what color you want the button to be. The best part is if all you wanted to
do is change the hover color for one button, you would only need to set the one variable and all the others would default
back to however they are defined! No pre-processor needed all you had to do was just start to come out of your shell and
realise that not every website needs to support IE11.

There is one downside to the approach of classes which is made very obvious by "anchor-btn btn btn-green" this is quite the mouth full
however there is a solution! css pre-processing! The most common of which being sass, in which there are two approaches:

1. define mixins for each of our classes from above, then create single class implementations for each you desire to use.

```scss
@mixin button-btn {
// ...
}
@mixin anchor-btn {
// ...
}
@mixin btn {
// ...
}
@mixin btn-green {
// ...
}

.anchor-btn {
  @include anchor-btn;
  @include btn;
}
.button-btn {
  @include button-btn;
  @include btn;
}
button.btn-green {
  @include button-btn;
  @include btn;
  @include btn-green;
}
button.btn-green {
  @include anchor-btn;
  @include btn;
  @include btn-green;
}
```
<br />

2. using extend: similar to the above, except you just create the btn, button-btn and anchor-btn classes and inside you
simply "`@extend: .btn`" for the "`.button-btn`" and you "`@extend: .button-btn`" for the "`.btn-green`".

do note that the order in which you include or extend does matter! The order is normalise => button styles => customisation
it needs to be this way as this is the order in which the css classes are defined in the original example and order when
you are using single class selectors is VERY important because specificity ends up being determined by what was written last
and thus we need to re-create this (when the lower inline styles overwrite the styles above them)
inside our single class solutions that mimics this.

The next way you can customise your button's appearance is really helpful for once off changes that you want to make quick
and dirty and looks like so:

<StepThreeDemo
  demoTwo
  className="html"
  code={`
<a style="--btn-background-color: #ff0021" />
  `}
/>
<br />

Another cool thing you could do is say you are making a st-patricks day post and you wanted to give the buttons
that are a part of your blog post a special green theme, well you can just place the style attribute like above with the css variable
on the main/article/div element that wraps your blog post and then automatiaclly all of your buttons become specially
themed! You could also overwrite the entire page's buttons even those outside of your blogpost by defining another "`:root`"
pseudo class, provided it is defined later in the document as the base css styling for your website, it will override all
the buttons on the page (except for the ones set with style attributes)! (you could even theme your entire website this way
and allow users to easily create their own themes for your website with this method)

# Wrapping up
<br />

This was quite the lengthy blog post, as I write this I am still deciding if I will split it up into three separate posts
OR if I will just leave it whole (as that is how I would consume it). I really found writing this post super helpful as
I ended up playing around with what I thought a good button was and now I truly think I have it down.

What's next? I plan on writing a follow-up to this piece explaining how I style buttons when I am using css-in-js libraries
as such as emotion and styled-components. I will pull apart the classes from this blog post, turn them into mixins and rather
similar to the sass pre-processing example I will build out my buttons that way. One benefit of using a css-in-js library
however is you can tidy up the inline theming like so:

```jsx
<button style="--btn-background-color: red"></button>
{/* becomes */}
<Button background"red"></Button>
```

Stay tuned for how exactly all of this is possible!
