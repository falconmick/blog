## Final Step 3: Customisation

Throughout this blog post, there have been multiple occurrences in which I have utilised css variables with some quick
wins but nothing too substantial coming from it. This post is where it all comes together, and this is where we see the
benefits of css variables and how they play such a critical role!

Instead of showing the final demo again, I will highlight ways in which you can customise your buttons. <Link to="/blog/2022/03/how-to-make-a-button-intro/">Click
here</Link> to go to the first post if you want the complete code.

First up is creating a new class to create a new green themed button:

<StepThreeDemo
  demoOne
  code={`
.btn.btn-green {
  --btn-color: #232323;
  --btn-background-color: #5cdb5c;
  --btn-background-color-hover: #7ce27c;
}
  `}
/>
<br />

This is what button perfection looks like in my eyes. You set up your styles so that when you want a new looking button,
you tell the button what colour you want it to be, and it just works. The best part is if all you wanted to do is change
the hover colour for one button, you would only need to set the one variable, and all the others would default back to
however they are defined! No pre-processor was required; all you had to do was start to come out of your shell and
realise that not every website needs to support IE11.

There is one downside to the approach of classes, which is made very obvious by "anchor-btn btn btn-green"; this is quite the mouth full.
However, there is a solution which is css pre-processing! The most common of which is sass, in which there are two approaches:

1. Define mixins for each of our classes from above, then create single class implementations for each you desire to create.

```scss
@mixin button-btn {
// ...
}
@mixin anchor-btn {
// ...
}
@mixin btn {
// ...
}
@mixin btn-green {
// ...
}

.anchor-btn {
  @include anchor-btn;
  @include btn;
}
.button-btn {
  @include button-btn;
  @include btn;
}
button.btn-green {
  @include button-btn;
  @include btn;
  @include btn-green;
}
button.btn-green {
  @include anchor-btn;
  @include btn;
  @include btn-green;
}
```
<br />

2. Using extend: is the same as above, except you create the btn, button-btn and anchor-btn classes and inside,
you simply "`@extend: .btn`" for the "`.button-btn`" and you "`@extend: .button-btn`" for the "`.btn-green`".

Do note that the order in which you include or extend does matter! That order is normalise => button styles => customisation.
It needs to be this way as this is the order in which the css classes are defined in the original example, and order,
when you are using single class selectors, is **very important** because specificity ends up being determined by what was written last.
Thus, we need to re-create this (when the lower inline styles overwrite the styles above them) inside our single class solutions to mimic this.

The following way you can customise your button's appearance is helpful for once-off changes that you want to make quick
and dirty and looks like so:

<StepThreeDemo
  demoTwo
  className="html"
  code={`
<a style="--btn-background-color: #ff0021" />
  `}
/>
<br />

Another cool thing you could do is say you are making an st Patricks' day post, and you wanted to give the buttons that
are a part of your blog post a unique green theme. You can place the style attribute like above with the css variable on
the main/article/div element that wraps your blog post, and then automatically, all of your buttons become specially themed!
You could also overwrite the entire page's buttons, even those outside of your blog post by defining another "`:root`" pseudo-class,
provided it is defined later in the document as the base css styling for your website it will just work.

### Wrapping up
<br />

This was quite a lengthy blog post; as I write this, I am still deciding if I will split it up into three separate posts (I did)
or leave it whole (as that is how I would consume it). I found writing this post super helpful as I ended up
playing around with what I thought an excellent button was, and now I genuinely believe I have writing a good button down.

What's next? I plan on writing a follow-up to this piece explaining how I style buttons when I am using css-in-js libraries,
such as emotion and styled-components. I will pull apart the classes from this blog post, turn them into mixins similar
to the sass pre-processing example, and build out my buttons. One benefit of using a css-in-js library is that you can
tidy up the inline theming like so:

```jsx
<button style="--btn-background-color: red"></button>
{/* becomes */}
<Button background"red"></Button>
```

Stay tuned for how exactly all of this is possible!
