It has almost been two years since the announcement and initial release of Github Copilot, the new wonder tech solution that's going to
take your and my job in the near future OR simply help us focus more on the problems and less on the boilerplate if you listen to 
Github's marketing department and/or some common sense.

for those of you not in the know Copilot is a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (more colloquially known as a GPT or AI) which has a multitude
of tools that let the developer using it interact through Chat, line level code completion or through the CLI. What makes Copilot special 
and unique to the offerings of a more generic GPT can be best summed up by two key differences:

1. The models is a fine tuned variant of OpenAI's GPT 3.5 which has been further refined by the entirety of the appropriately licensed Github
ecosystem. This allows Copilot to take GPT 3.5's ability to hold a "conversation" with you while also giving it just about every possible
example of how code is written (bot good and bad) thanks to it's vast data-set.
2. Copilot is delivered to the user through their IDE, be that VS Code, Visual Studio or the Intellij platform via an extension. This extension
then provides a chat window and code completion support but at the same time also bundles up a bunch of context around what files the user
has open (and their contents) which then allows the user to both transparently get improved results tailored to what they're working on as well
as allowing then to specifically call out files and have them submitted as context around the prompts they're making.

Now that we have a basic understanding of what Copilot is, lets talk about what I believe it is not. 

Allot of the demo's that you will see for Copilot is how you can ask it to create a bubble search algorithm OR generate you some HTML. There's 
just one problem with that, these are demo's and not actual code that we would want written. Why would I use a GPT to write an algorithm I 
didn't fully understand? That sounds like a recipe for disaster as I don't know if the solution is good enough. Ok What if I do understand the
algorithm? Why am I even writing/generating my own where I know for sure there will be a better bubble sort algorithm in my package manager or
even inbuilt in the language. 

What about the more boilerplate example of the HTML? It's amazing how I can ask for a little details like plant emoji's or for it to be in a
table and for the result to be more or less what I wanted. But This type of generation only really works in a more realistic project if we
are using a utility based css framework like tailwind, otherwise the odd's that it will re-use the custom classes for your system OR generate
the appropriately constructed CSS rules is very low and only really good for an example.

That's the crux of the problem, It's a great demo tool but not as amazing for real work in my experiences. It will on occasion provide me a
line completion for soothing obvious (which is a bonus) and if I really needed some code explained I theoretically could ask it, but at that point
the issue is not that I need a tool to explain to me the code I'm working on but instead probably that I need to talk/work with the developer
who created it so that we can simplify it such that it doesn't need explaining. 

There is still one way in which Copilot can help save large chunks of effort and provide actual value and that is with adhoc Template creation.
