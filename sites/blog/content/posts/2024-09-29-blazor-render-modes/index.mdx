I decided to start taking a deeper look into blazor now that it's finally with dotnet 8 getting the killer feature of
wasm based rendering. What I discovered as a somebody who primarily has used react up until now for more user interactivity
intensive front end applications is that the render modes and where what certain parts of the app are rendered and when
I should choose one over the other to be allot more complicated than I had expected. I decided that it could be a good
idea to take what I discovered and turn that into this very blog post. I expect I will make mistakes, so I would strongly
suggest using this post as a kicking off into your own deep dive into the docs and other resources. Once your an expect
I would love any feedback via any of the socials OR you could even go to the bottom of this page and click the link
to submit a PR to correct anything that's not quite right.

## The four ways to render
The first thing that I stumbled on when getting started was trying to understand what rendering mode I should pick
and what that would actually give me. It had not clicked yet that there are two main mechanisms of how content is
rendered and then mutated through user interactions. Those two mechanisms are **Page Rendering** and **Render Mode**.
(great change here for a PR with more accurate to the ecosystem names!)

## Render Modes
[Render Modes as described by the docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/render-modes?view=aspnetcore-8.0&viewFallbackFrom=aspnetcore-6.0):
|Name |	Description | 	Render location | 	Interactive |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
|Static Server |	Static server-side rendering (static SSR) |	Server |	❌No|

|Interactive Server 	Interactive server-side rendering (interactive SSR) using Blazor Server. 	Server 	✔️Yes|
|Interactive WebAssembly 	Client-side rendering (CSR) using Blazor WebAssembly†. 	Client 	✔️Yes|
|Interactive Auto 	Interactive SSR using Blazor Server initially and then CSR on subsequent visits after the Blazor bundle is downloaded. 	Server, then client 	✔️|



### Page Rendering
This is likely the
