Welcome to my blog and it's first ever post!
I've decided to make this blog to document my prior works that I have done at Murdoch University and the stuff
I'm currently working on whilst I look for employment. I plan over the following few months to start development
of a cross platform RPG engine, while I develop it I will also be working with a test game of which
I aspire to one day release to the public for free (maybe with some premium features as such as
cross platform save files). I also have plans to develop tools for scheduling and organisation on smartphones.
This blog will not be limited to purely coding projects, it's primary focus will be,
but I also plan on blogging my day to day computing life including employment and other IT related events I attend.
