This blog post has been a long way coming but after many re-attempts to build the blogging platform
of my desires, I have finally settled on this one! Welcome all to My (new) Coding Life!

### How we got there

One of the reasons this project has taken so long to complete has been because of technology
more specifically the choice of what packages and structure I was going to use to form my
new blog as a gatsby.

The Journey started with a fairly simple idea: "Why don't I just re-build my blog from scratch from the ground up using gatsby themes"
I mean how hard could it be...

The first 1-2 attempts to build my blog all ended up just fizzling out due to a combination of leaving it too
long between sessions of work and just loosing my flow as well as a few major changes to Gatsby of
which it ended up being easier to just start again.

My second latest go at getting my blog up and running was prior to themes getting announced so my first attempts
was to just simply to get a Gatsby site up and running utilising a MarkDown rendering engine (at the time remark)
and a css-in-js library (emotion) however I was yet to discover the truly hardest part of writing your blog from
scratch... Actually finishing it before all of the code becomes irrelevant (well at least in my eyes, probably would
have been fine!)

In this second last real attempt I ended up getting really bogged down in splitting the HTML markdown + css layer from a higher up
theme based layer. This was truly a grand mistake as I ended up spending the majority of my time trying to architect
the perfect abstraction instead of just delivering what mattered, which was the actual implementation of the blog.

I gave up shortly after bogging myself down with non critical issues and didn't try again until Gatsby Themes were announced. For those
who are not in the know, Gatsby Themes is a combination of using mono repos and wordpress inspired file shadowing.
Shadowing can be super powerful as it allows you to define a base implementation of which child themes can overwrite.
this allows creation of pipeline themes that render placeholders which give a child theme
the opportunity to define what a page will look like and then to create a blog post without any config.
This would allow me to split my codebase into layers and build up from pieces
the exact blog platform I desired. For more information check out the [release announcement from Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-07-03-announcing-stable-release-gatsby-themes/)

Which is what led me to the platform that you are (unless I re-built it since) reading on now. For this time around
I had a change of priorities. Instead of building the entire website from scratch finessing each and every style, package
and layout to my hearts content, I instead looked for somebody who had already done what I wanted to do. I wanted to use
gatsby themes to split my website up into four main parts:
1. Basic Mdx Page Engine (if a site/theme implements this they can define a page layout and mdx files will automatically
utilise this template with 0 config) This will allow for construction of content pages without the need of a CMS
2. Mdx Blog Engine (if a site/theme implements this they can define a series of templates: post, post-teaser, archive page, tag page
and will allow for creation of blog posts when placed within posts directory) which allows for creation of blog posts
in a structured way.
3. Theme that implements the Page and Blog engine thus providing the HTML/CSS and all of the above goodies to the implementor
of this theme.
4. The actual site, of which implements the Theme and only defines content as such as pages and posts.

<Img
  imgStyle={{objectFit: "contain"}}
  style={{maxHeight: "600px", maxWidth: "default"}}
  fluid={props.localImages[8].full.fluid}
  alt="diagram showing how the blog is structured as a series of core components which layer upon each other"
  style={{paddingBottom: "16px"}}
/>


I wanted this approach as it was a way to clearly separate core functionality from layout and implementation. This way
in a years time when I've decided that I don't like my theme one bit and want to start from scratch, I don't actually
have to start from scratch, I just implement a new Theme layer and keep my Page + Blog engine and my content just implements the new
theme. I could even theoretically run two theme layers at once and allow users to swap between domains and get the same
core content.

4 attempts and 3 years later and the day to swap from blogspot to my very own Gatsby blog has finally arrived. If you
read this far then thanks :) feel free to open a PR with any spelling errors or corrections!
