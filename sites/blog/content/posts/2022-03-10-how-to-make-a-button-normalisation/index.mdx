### Step 1: Normalisation

This is the first and most important step in making convincing reusable buttons and also the one that people get
wrong the most, as typically a developer will take a `<button class="cool-button" />` apply some padding + background + border and call
it a day.

This is the wrong approach because what happens 2 days later when that form submitting button that the managers
just loved to pieces now needs to be used to create a link from /categories over to /categories/pop. Well what happens
is the developer will start out with `<a class="cool-button" />` and all of a sudden realise that their button has a weird
color when it's hovered, that it gets an underline and finally that the display is inline instead of an inline block. What
they didn't discover is that once the user goes to that link the button text changes color to unfortunately a color very similar
to their buttons custom styling, of which they never noticed because they were working backwards trying to force an element
that already has pre-existing looks and feels into a class that was never designed for it. What is worse is depending on how this
is done it could even end up making the original button not look right + when we start to use more than one different color
button it can just get super hard to keep bending the unplanned css design to bend to the systems needs.

This is why it's always best to start out with a baseline, that baseline being a normalised span of text with 0 browser
styling and 0 custom styling (aka if you are using tailwind, it's time to apply some additional work to make sure your
button looks as much like plain old boring text as possible.). see what that looks like here:

<StepOneDemo />
<br />

As you can see, now the button and the anchor tag both look identical to the span tag, they are normalised and now ready
to receive the button styling. You might have also noticed "`--btn-color: #FFFFFF`" and also "`color: var(--btn-color);`"
what this is, is the starts to how we apply theming to our buttons, it basically boils down to: "`color: #FFFFFF`" however
we use the css variable --brn-color as a way to allow future styles further down in the stylesheet (and therefore with a higher
precedence to any style with the same specificity as such as .btn) can overwrite it's meaning and thus change the color of the
text.

But why do this in the reset instead of just doing it inside the button styling? It feels pretty redundant doing this work twice!
HOWEVER there is some reason behind this madness, which is not everybody has a shadow dom like I do to render their butons inside of
(maybe you using web components and do?) which means sometimes some pretty nasty styles can pollute the global styling of your
elements. Say for example what if somebody decided to make something like so:

```css
a:hover {
  color: red !important;
}
```

This is such a big deal when it comes to our button (and in general all css, please for the love of all things holy just
stop using !important and start planning out your specificity) because now our button styling must include a fix
for the anchor tags un-normalised look and feel. This is an issue purely because it pollutes the styles of your button and
makes it less and less about the buttons look and feel and more about one version of the buttons look and feel.

By using css variables when we apply our normalisation fix on our anchor tag to fix the above:

```css
.anchor-btn {
  --btn-color: #FFFFFF;
  display: inline-block;
  text-decoration: unset;
  color: var(--btn-color);
}
a.anchor-btn:hover {
  color: var(--btn-color) !important;
}
```

What's also cool about using css variables here is that it also means that when somebody implements a custom button
they don't get the bug where the quick fix for a bad important (as show above) takes precedence over their custom
theme color and thus we automatically get a fixed button in the new color of button without having to write another
fix for the "`!important`" code!

If you are wondering what the "`:root`" thing is at the top, this is just a pseudo selector that selects the root of the
document and defines your css variable globally. Your first gut reaction might be one of shock and horror, we just spent
the last 10 years migrating to esm to get away from global name conflicts, and now we go and start standardising on them! The
concern is correct HOWEVER the general rule of thumb with a best practice, is that as soon as you know why the best
practice of avoiding globals exists (i.e. name clashing) you can feel some form of safety in using them provided you
keep that in mind. This is why we didn't just call our "`--btn-color`" variable "`--color`", as the author of the website
I take ownership of the global css variables and as such I would never allow for any other library to be utilised which
haphazardly defined css variables which were overly generic and in doing so I am left free to use them.

But with all the risks of this global definition of my button's variable what are the gains? Easy, the ability to
customise theming of sections of my dom. Say for example I want to make the sidebar's button text color hot pink?
easy I define the aside like so:

```html
<style>
aside {
  --btn-color: #FF69B4; // or <aside style="--btn-color: #FF69B4;">
}
</style>
<aside>
  Look at my <button class="btn button-btn">HOT PINK</button> button
</aside>
```

You might notice that I don't actually set the cursor to default. This is because I know that I am
100% going to be setting these in the next step so there is literally no point to, thus our button and anchor tags still
have their pointer cursor.
