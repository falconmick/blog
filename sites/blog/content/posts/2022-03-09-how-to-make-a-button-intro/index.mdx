It feels like making a reusable button that just works for everything should be easy; but if you have never
made one or if you've never had time thoughtfully build one from scratch they can be a plain and simple pain
to maintain.

To save you from scrolling to the end of the post here is what we are working toward:

If you look at the comments in the css you can see the three important parts to how to design reusable and consistent
buttons that work for any and all HTML elements. Those steps consist of:

1. Normalise the element to look as if it were an un-styled span of text (typically I use inline-block however for display).
2. Apply button styling
3. Apply customisation for individual button (as such as color)
