It feels like making a reusable button that works for everything should be easy, but if you have never made one or if
you've never had time to think while build one from scratch; they can be a pain to maintain.

Over the next four blog posts, we will dig into the ins and outs of what it takes to build a reusable button that is
sure to scale with the ever-increasing needs of your project as it matures. But what we learn here need not be used in
isolation; there are plenty of other instances in which you want a component to work for any semantical element,
and you can use the same principles there.

Before we start, here is the result that we are working towards:

If you look at the comments in the css, you can see the three critical parts of designing reusable and consistent
buttons that work for any HTML elements. Those steps consist of:

1. Normalise the element to look like an un-styled span of text.
2. Apply button styling
3. Apply customisation for the individual button (as such as colour)

We split the styling up into these three stages for ease of development and assurance that our buttons will look correct
no matter what elements we end up utilising for the button. Using the right element for the button, be it input, button,
OR anchor, is hypercritical if you want to build a website that the user's browser and accessibility tools can understand.
It's not acceptable to have a button with an onclick event that triggers a route change, you should be giving your users
an anchor tag, and it shouldn't look any different.
